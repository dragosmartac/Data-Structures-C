# Data Structures in C

This repository currently provides a generic hash table implementation using void pointers.

The file named hash_table_tests.c provides examples of different uses of the generic hash table. You can use the atached makefile to compile and run it.

## Makefile commands:

1. Compile the files and run the executable file named hash_table_tests
```bash
% make
% ./hash_table_tests
```
2. Compile and run the executable, using the valgrind tool to check for memory leaks.
```bash
% make run_tests
```
3. Clean all the binaries

```bash
% make clean
```
